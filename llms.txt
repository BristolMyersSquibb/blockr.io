## Available Blocks

### Read Block

Load data from multiple sources with automatic format detection:

- **From Browser**: Upload files via drag-and-drop (persisted across
  sessions)
- **From Server**: Browse the file system directly
- **From URL**: Download data from web URLs

Supports CSV, Excel, Parquet, Feather, JSON, SPSS, Stata, SAS, and more.

### Write Block

Export data to various formats with two output modes:

- **To Browser**: Download files directly (recommended for most users)
- **To Server**: Write to the file system (for automated pipelines)

Supports CSV, Excel, Parquet, and Feather. Multiple inputs become Excel
sheets or ZIP archives.
