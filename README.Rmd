# blockr.io

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Upload and download multiple file formats such as Excel, csv, xpt, etc. to and from a blockr data pipeline.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blockr.io from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cynkra/blockr.io")
```

## Example

Several example Excel files are available from [readxl::readxl_example()] as

```r
readxl::readxl_example("clippy.xlsx")
```

Such a file can then be round-tripped as

```r
library(blockr.core)
library(blockr.io)

serve(
  new_board(
    blocks = blocks(
      a = new_readxlsx_block(),
      b = new_writexlsx_block()
    ),
    links = links(ab = new_link("a", "b"))
  )
)
```
